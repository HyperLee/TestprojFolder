# Contracts for World Clock Feature

This directory will contain API contracts and interface definitions for the World Clock feature.

## Purpose

Contracts define the data structures and interfaces that will be used across the World Clock implementation, ensuring consistency between different components.

## Planned Contracts

Contracts will be defined during the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`) based on the requirements in [spec.md](../spec.md).

Potential contracts may include:

- Clock display data structure
- City timezone configuration
- Time state management interface
- Visual styling constants

**Note**: This is a placeholder. Actual contracts will be created during the implementation planning phase.
